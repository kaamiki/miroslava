SAMPLE COMMIT
-------------

[v1.0.0] Add more internal constants
Apr 11, 2020 - v1.0.0.dev.1

Added:
- New constants like `NEW_CONSTANT_1`, `NEW_CONSTANT_2`, `NEW_CONSTANT_3`
  and `NEW_CONSTANT_4` with descriptions in `miroslava.config.internals`

Changed:
- `USR` is now `SESSION_USER` and `SEP` is now `PATH_SEP`. This provides more
  clarity and makes the usage more non-esoteric in nature.
